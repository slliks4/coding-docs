🔥 This plan is exactly the balance you need – it keeps your current web dev career on track while letting you grow as a true engineer. Let's refine and lock it in so you can follow it step by step without burnout:

---

## ✅ Refined Version of Your Plan

### **1️⃣ Automate the boring parts (stay efficient in web dev)**

* **Main goal:** Prevent burnout by turning repetitive work (DRF setup, JWT, CORS, caching) into scripts and templates.
* **Languages/tools:**

  * **Bash/Lua** → scripting & automation for backend setup, dotfiles, dev environment
  * **TypeScript, React, Django, Tailwind, CSS frameworks (MUI, Bootstrap)** → speed up actual web projects
* **Mindset:**

  * Avoid hand-coding UIs you don’t enjoy. Leverage component libraries and Tailwind.
  * Keep improving automation scripts whenever you learn a better pattern.

💡 *End result:* Web dev feels lighter, faster, and you free mental energy for deeper learning.

---

### **2️⃣ Dive into C (for real CS understanding)**

* **Why C first?** It teaches:

  * Memory management, pointers
  * How operating systems and compilers work
  * How languages like Python and JavaScript are built on top of lower layers
* **Approach:**

  * Write small tools (build your own `ls`, `grep`, or text editor)
  * Solve problems on **LeetCode** in C (forces understanding of pointers & data structures)
  * Make mistakes & debug: that’s where real learning happens

---

### **3️⃣ Build CS Fundamentals Alongside C**

* Focus areas:

  * **Data Structures & Algorithms:** arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, hashing, dynamic programming
  * **Computer Architecture:** how CPUs, memory, storage, and processes interact
  * **Operating Systems concepts:** processes, threads, scheduling, virtual memory
* Use C to test your knowledge (implement your own linked list, malloc, caching mechanism, etc.).

---

### **4️⃣ Explore System Internals & AI/ML Foundations**

* Don’t dive straight into AI projects yet, but **study how the tools work**.

  * Read the PyTorch, TensorFlow, or NumPy source code sections.
  * Follow blogs or books explaining **ML frameworks architecture**.
  * Focus on core math (linear algebra, probability, optimization).
* This gives you a conceptual edge for when you’re ready to work on AI/ML seriously.

---

### **5️⃣ Problem-Solving & Competitive Edge**

* Solve **LeetCode** problems in C:

  * Helps you internalize data structures
  * Builds muscle memory for interviews
  * Makes higher-level languages feel easier
* Later, try solving in **Rust** for ownership and performance concepts.

## 🔥 Key Advantages of This Plan

1. **Your career stays stable** – web dev pays the bills, but now it’s lighter thanks to automation.
2. **You gain CS depth without pressure** – C and CS fundamentals slowly turn you into a systems-level thinker.
3. **You future-proof yourself** – low-level knowledge makes you a better full-stack dev *and* prepares you for ML, AI, or even kernel-level work later.
4. **You get to enjoy coding again** – working on tools and automations you love breaks the monotony.

---

## 📆 Suggested Flow (Manageable Weekly Schedule)

* **Daily (1-2 hrs)**

  * 60% web dev tasks (paid work or internship)
  * 40% C + CS fundamentals

* **Weekends (if free)**

  * LeetCode in C (DSA focus)
  * Work on automation scripts (small wins → keeps you motivated)

---

## 📌 Extra Motivation

> Your scripting and automation tools could even turn into **open-source projects** or a **starter kit** others can use. That makes your work visible (for GitHub + employers) *and* you enjoy building it.

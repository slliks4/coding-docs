One question with the signup,

How do you keep the database clean, Like I am saying what happens when I signup with another phone number or credentials, but retain the same firstname and last name does it make me a new member

FIXED: Phone number as unique Identifier, only canadian number allowed to register
Before one can have access to important part of the application they must be first verified by the admin, there by reducing spam and malicious user

Then next will just be verfication, what happens if I loose my phone number, given I can't change it how will I go about that



Given the requirement of church can be dynamic rather than fixed, What about making the those field a create field by admin, that way we don't need to contact the developer everytime we let's say create a new department or position.

I loved how you used


for the ride share, can you show us the admin dashboard handling that, after this ?


EVerything in the home page was nice, I would have just like to have the admin page that handles all admin logic, to be separate,

Then Still out of concern for data duplicaiton, Just mentioning, it will be nice to have a fallback for duplicate first name and last name for both adult and children because another example one can also steal someone identity by using their name 


I loved everything, it looks like everything was thoroughly thought through, but then I feel the app is too big for a single applicaiton, 

Apart from separating, the admin responsibilties to a separate admin page which I feel will be much more better freeing up the main app it self, because now I am looking at performance, and error prone, as we all know the larger the app the more error prone it becomes, I would Like to take each things as a feature, and work one them separately still under thesame domain, but different apps focused on one thing that way things we don't need and all we don't have to implement, we just implement what we need alone


Here’s a concise summary you can bring up during your presentation:

---

**Proposal: Modular App Structure for Better Performance and Maintainability**

* **Separate Admin Panel**: Move admin features to a dedicated app/page to keep the main app lightweight and focused on users.

* **Performance Boost**: Smaller apps load faster and are easier to manage.

* **Reduced Errors**: Isolating features makes debugging and testing simpler.

* **Feature-Based Scalability**: Each app handles a single purpose (e.g., core app, admin, auth), making development and updates more organized.

* **No Bloat**: Only implement what’s needed—no extra code or dependencies in the main app.

Let me know if you want to add visuals or examples to support it.
